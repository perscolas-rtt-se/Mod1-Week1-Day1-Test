    <b>How to learn in this course</b> 
</summary>


- Things are not always going to go as planned. <br>
![Slide 3 image](/images/slide3.png)

- Being confused/lost is NORMAL. No one pays you because you know all the answers. The job is about jumping into confusion and being able to find a solution. Get comfortable with being uncomfortable.

- The maximum point of learning is right at the edge of learning and panic.

***

- This experience is a rollercoaster.

<b>Successful Students:</b>

- Find programming fascinating. They don't think of it as an obligation or chore.

- Go above and beyond what we teach. If there is something they feel they should know, they will go and learn it. If there is a problem for which they think they need more information to solve, they go and find that information.

- Don't wait for instructors to hand them the answer.
See that programming is not about learning a recipe, it's about developing a mindset to solve unforeseen problems. One size does not fit all.

- Work Hard: Students should be ready to apply 20-25 hours/week outside of the classroom for studying.

***

<b>Collaborative Culture in the Classroom</b>

- Take care of each other

- Benchmarking: some are good at one thing, others at another

- Leverage each other's strengths.

- Teaching is the best way of truly solidifying your understanding of a concept

- Your classmates will be the best foundation for establishing a professional network in tech!

- Golden Rule: If your not asking for help or asking someone if they need help - your doing something wrong.

    <b>Common Concerns</b>
</summary>

- I'm making a lot of mistakes

    - mistakes are a part of life as a developer

- I don't feel comfortable with the material
    - you probably will never feel the material is easy, but you should be able to do the work

    - by the end of each module project, you should feel mostly comfortable with the material
- I feel good during class, but it's difficult to innovate on my own
    - There are three stages to learning something:
        - Imitation (follow along)
        - Assimilation (repetitive simple tasks: homework and labs)
        - Innovation (build something new on your own - project time)
- Everyone at work will realize I know nothing
    - this is called the imposter syndrome, and it's very common
    - nobody knows everything, it's about how well you learn
- I don't "do" math
    - that's why we have the computer do it for us!
    - programming is more about thinking logically than doing equations

- What's the best practice? What's the one "correct" answer?
    - Best practices change constantly and from company to company
    - If you think properly, you'll probably naturally arrive at a best practice
    - All that matters is "Does it work?"
        - A company that hires someone with 3 months of experience doesn't really care about code quality
        - Use your time to learn new technology or strengthen your problem solving
